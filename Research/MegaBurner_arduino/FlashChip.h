/**
 * FlashChip
 *
 * Common interface for all chip drivers (MX29L3211, MX29LV320E,
 * MX26L6420, ...), so MegaBurner_arduino.ino can select which chip is
 * physically connected at RUNTIME (via a host command) instead of
 * needing a firmware reflash per chip.
 *
 * NOTE: read8()/write8() are intentionally NOT part of this interface.
 * They're dead code in every existing chip driver (MegaBurner_arduino.ino
 * only ever calls read16()/write16() - the host always operates in
 * 16-bit/word mode), so there's no reason to force every chip driver to
 * implement/expose them polymorphically.
