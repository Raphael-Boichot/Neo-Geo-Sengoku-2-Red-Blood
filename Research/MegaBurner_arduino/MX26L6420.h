/**
 * MX26L6420
 *
 * 64Mbit [4M x 16] MTP EPROM, Macronix. 16-bit ONLY - there is no
 * BYTE# pin on this chip at all (confirmed from the pin description:
 * Q0-Q15 are always active, no byte-mode fallback), unlike
 * MX29LV320E's switchable x8/x16.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this chip is rated for only ~100 erase/program cycles
 * (vs. 100,000+ for the flash chips) - far less margin for mistakes.
 *
 * Ported from MX29LV320E.h. Verified against the datasheet
 * (Macronix P/N: PM0823, REV. 0.5, JAN. 29, 2002), Table 4 "MX26L6420
 * COMMAND DEFINITIONS":
 *
 *  - Unlock addresses: 0x555 / 0x2AA - SAME as MX29LV320E.
 *  - Chip Erase: 555/AA, 2AA/55, 555/80, 555/AA, 2AA/55, 555/10 -
 *    IDENTICAL sequence to MX29LV320E.
 *  - Program: 555/AA, 2AA/55, 555/A0, PA/PD - single-word program
 *    only (no page-buffer feature), same as MX29LV320E. Requires
 *    page_size=2 from the host, same reasoning as MX29LV320E.
 *  - Status: "the system can determine the status of the erase
 *    operation by using Q7, Q6" - same dual DQ7+DQ6 polling as
 *    MX29LV320E, for the same reasons (see busyCheck() below and the
 *    comment history in MX29LV320E.h for why DQ7 alone isn't enough).
 *  - Reset is DIFFERENT: table shows "Reset | 1 cycle | XXX | F0" -
 *    a SINGLE bus cycle, don't-care address, no unlock prefix. This
 *    is unlike MX29L3211/MX29LV320E, which both need a 3-cycle
 *    unlock+F0 sequence.
 *  - Silicon ID: manufacturer C2h at address 0, device code 22FCh at
 *    address 1 (only the low byte, FCh, is read here - see readId()
 *    in the .ino file for why that's sufficient).
 *
 * This chip also has a dedicated hardware RESET pin (active low) -
 * but it's only broken out on the 48-TSOP package, not on 44-SOP
 * (confirmed from the pinout). Since this project uses the 44-SOP
 * package, that pin simply isn't accessible here and there's nothing
 * to wire up or worry about - the chip is controlled entirely via the
 * software reset command (single F0 write, see reset() below), same
 * mechanism as the other two chips.
