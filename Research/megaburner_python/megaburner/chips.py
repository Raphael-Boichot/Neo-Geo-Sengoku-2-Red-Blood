"""Chip definitions.

Ported from Chips.java / chips/Chip.java / chips/MX29L3211.java.

To add a new chip, add another entry to CHIPS below - every field is
required and documented so the shape is easy to copy. Verify every
field against the chip's own datasheet first - never assume it matches
an existing entry. See README.md "Adding another chip".
